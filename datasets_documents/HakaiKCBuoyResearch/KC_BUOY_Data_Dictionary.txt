Data dictionary for KC_BUOY_May2018_Jan2020.txt

(1) Mooring Name: Name/description of mooring
(2) Latitude: Mooring latitude in decimal degrees
(3) Longitude: Mooring longitude in decimal degrees 
(4) Date: UTC date (mm/dd/yyyy)
(5) Time: UTS time (hh:mm)
(6) xCO2 SW (wet): (umol/mol) Mole fraction of CO2 in air in equilibrium with the seawater at sea surface temperature and measured humidity
(7) CO2 SW QF: Flag for xCO2 sw (wet)
(8) H20 SW: (mmol/mol) Mole fraction of H2O in air from equilibrator
(9) xCO2 Air (wet): (umol/mol) Mole fraction of CO2 in air from airblock, 4 feet above the sea surface at measured humidity.
(10) CO2 Air QF: Quality Flag for xCO2 Air (wet)
(11) H20 Air: (mmol/mol) Mole fraction of H2O in air from airblock, 4 feet above the sea surface.
(12) Licor Atm Pressure: (hPa) Atmospheric pressure at the airblock, 4 feet above the sea surface.
(13) Licor Temp: (C) Temperature of the Infrared Licor 820 in degrees Celsius.
(14) MAPCO2 %O2: The percent oxygen of the surface seawater divided by the percent oxygen of the atmosphere at 4 feet above the sea surface. Disclaimer: The oxygen measurement is made in the equilibrated air and does not come to complete equilibrium therefore this measurement is qualitative and for diagnostic use only.
(15) SST: (C) Sea Surface Temperature.
(16) Salinity: Sea Surface Salinity on the practical scale.
(17) TS QF: Flag for SST and Salinity
(18) xCO2 SW (dry): (umol/mol) Mole fraction of CO2 in air in equilibrium with the seawater at sea surface temperature (dry air).
(19) xCO2 Air (dry): (umol/mol) Mole fraction of CO2 in air at the airblock, 4 feet above the sea surface (dry air).
(20) fCO2 SW (sat): (uatm) Fugacity of CO2 in air in equilibrium with the seawater at sea surface temperature (100% humidity). Since the measurements are taken at the sea surface, warming calculations are not necessary.
(21) fCO2 Air (sat): (uatm) Fugacity of CO2 in air at the airblock, 4 feet above the sea surface (100% humidity)
(22) dfCO2: Difference of the fugacity of the CO2 in seawater and the fugacity of the CO2 in air (fCO2 SW - fCO2 Air).
(23) pCO2 SW (sat): (uatm) Partial Pressure of CO2 in air in equilibrium with the seawater at sea surface temperature (100% humidity)
(24) pCO2 Air (sat): (uatm) Partial Pressure of CO2 in air at the airblock, 4 feet above the sea surface (100% humidity).
(25) dpCO2: Difference of the partial pressure of CO2 in seawater and air (pCO2 SW - pCO2 Air).
